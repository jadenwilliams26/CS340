In building maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, it is important to focus on clear code structure, meaningful variable names, modular design, and thorough documentation. Working on the CRUD Python module in Project One provided a strong foundation for connecting dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. This modular approach offered key advantages, such as making the code easier to debug, update, and expand for future needs. Moving forward, this CRUD module could be reused in different projects that require database interaction, saving time and ensuring consistency.

When approaching problems as a computer scientist, I focus on breaking down requirements into manageable pieces and designing scalable solutions. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I carefully analyzed the database and dashboard requirements before designing the system architecture. Compared to previous assignments, this project required more real-world client focus and emphasized creating practical, user-driven solutions. In the future, I would continue using strategies like early prototyping, client feedback loops, and clear schema planning to better meet diverse database needs.

Computer scientists solve complex problems through logical thinking, creativity, and technical skill â€” and their work directly impacts how businesses operate. Projects like this help companies like Grazioso Salvare by improving data management, enhancing operational efficiency, and enabling smarter decision-making through effective dashboards and database systems.
